# Module-2-challenge

## task

In this assignment, i have to create a web application that gave you name, image, porfolio, about me, work, resume, and contact.

I created a html and css 

in the html, linked the css stylesheet. Then in the body added the header, nav, main with sections, and a footer. Used ul, aside, id, and href.

In the CSS, used flexbox, medai queries, and css variables. also used it to pick the color and adjust the border size, padding, font sizing, flex wrap, width, height, and a:hover.

Added the css into the assets folder along with an image.





what is below was from the assignment folder of module 2, i copied the user story and acceptance criteria 

## User story 

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
